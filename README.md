# IPL-Score-Prediction-using-Neural-Networks

This project utilizes a neural network model to predict the total score in IPL cricket matches based on venue, batting team, and bowling team. The dataset is preprocessed by encoding categorical variables and scaling features. The model is built with Keras and TensorFlow, and it uses Huber loss for robust regression. An interactive widget is included for users to input match details and get score predictions in real-time.
